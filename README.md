# Java blockchain with Spring

I made this project to learn about blockchain and Bitcoin in general, because my further goal is to develop a bitcoin wallet.

This is an UTXO blockchain just like the king of all cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin. Currently it is just a simple **Spring** back-end api. The documentation can be found here:

My future plans are to make it to a real P2P network and to make it as realistic as possible.

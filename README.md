# Java blockchain with Spring

I made this project to learn about blockchain and Bitcoin in general, because my further goal is to develop a bitcoin wallet.
This is an UTXO blockchain just like the king of all cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin. Currently it is just a simple **Spring** back-end api, with enpoints like:
  - /api/genesis
  - /api/new-wallet
  - /api/new-transaction
  - /api/mine-next-block
  - /api/get-blockchain
  - /api/get-balance
  - /api/get-transaction-info/{id}

My future plans are to make it to a real P2P network and to make it as realistic as possible.
